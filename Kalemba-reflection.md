What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

When to merge branches and when and how to push changes to github.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Merge conflict when and how to push commits to GitHub
Fetch and Merge

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I had to no pair but I asked my guide the difference between fetch and merge and just pulling the repo.

What still confuses you about Git?

When to commit and which branch should be up to date at what time.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Unfortunately I did not have a pair it was just a guide so it was a little difficult to do the GPS alone. The Guide helped to answer any questions I had but it would have been better with pair.
